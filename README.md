# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage

Challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for the Room Homepage challenge in Frontend Mentor. 

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out an e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size âœ…
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page âœ…
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard âœ…

This is the result: https://room-homepage-frontend-mentor.vercel.app/
